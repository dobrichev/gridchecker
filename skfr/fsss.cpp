A Fast Simple Sudoku Solver by Mladen Dobrichev

No limitations for reusing, but citing somewhere my name is welcome.
There are parts of code taken from bb_sudoku by Brian Turner. Thank you, Brian!

The entry point is
	int fsss(const char* in, unsigned long long maxSolutions, char* out).

Terminology:
"Game" is the puzzle along with the whole context during processing.
Puzzle consist of 81 "Cells".
Each cell is member of three "Groups" - its "Row", "Column", and "Square".
The rest of the cells within the same row, column, and square are "Affected Cells".
Segment is a combination of first/second/third three rows or columns.
"Triplets" are first/second/third subsequent 3 cells within the rows and columns.
"Affected Triplets" for a given triplet are the rest of the triplets in the same row/col and square.
***************************************************************************/

//No global variables
//Runtime Library function calls are limited to memcpy (hidden, when assigning the game struct).

//There is an Intel Compiler specific pragma "unroll" which causes significant improvement in the SetDigit function.
//It is critical this loop to be unrolled to obtain good performance. Splitting the loop into chunks
//may cause other compilers to unroll them. Last resort is manual unrolling.

//Use constants and tabular functions whenever possible

//Convert mask to a number (1 to 9) if only the appropriate bit is set.
//Convert zero to 9, allowing cellDigit to char conversion using the same table.
