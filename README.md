# gridchecker

Gridchecker is a general purpose command line toolset for playing with Sudoku puzzles and solution grid structures.
Currently it works on 64-bits Linux and compiles with g++. It should be easy to port to 64-bits Windows.

See the branch "pg" useful for playing Patterns Game in http://forum.enjoysodoku.com

Enjoy!
